#  Define a set that contains tuples. Each tuple should contain two strings:

    #The name of an artist
    #A song by that artist
    #Make sure that some of the songs are from the band Nickelback.

song_list_a = set(
    ('Beyonce', 'Single Ladies'),
    ('Beyonce', 'Ego'),
    ('Beyonce', 'Halo'),
    ('Nickelback', 'How You Remind Me'),
    ('Nickelback', 'That Power'),
    ('Nickelback', 'Animals')
)

#  Using a set comprehension, create a new set that contains all songs that were not performed by Nickelback.
